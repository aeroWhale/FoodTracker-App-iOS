# FoodTracker-App-iOS
An iOS application that user can save the name, rating and photo of the food they had. 

This is a practicing app that follow the instruction by Apple's Food Tracker tutorial. 

Note:
The Apple's tutorial is based on Swift 3, there's a place need to change when build it with Swift 4: for functions that are going to be used in `#selector` expression, you need to add `@obj` at the declaration of the function, just before the `func` keyword.
